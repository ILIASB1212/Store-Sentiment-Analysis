Store Sentiment Analysis 🛒🔍
A Machine Learning project to classify customer reviews as positive or not positive.

📌 Project Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze customer reviews and determine their sentiment. It uses TF-IDF vectorization and a classification model to achieve 88% accuracy in sentiment prediction.

🚀 Features
✅ Preprocesses text data (stopword removal, tokenization, etc.)
✅ Uses TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features
✅ Trains a Machine Learning classifier for sentiment analysis
✅ Saves the trained model for future predictions
✅ Provides a function for real-time sentiment prediction

📊 Technologies Used
🔹 Python
🔹 Scikit-learn
🔹 TF-IDF Vectorization
🔹 Machine Learning Classification Model
🔹 Joblib (for model saving & loading)

📂 Use the predicting() function to analyze sentiment:


text = "The dress quality is amazing!"
predicting(text)  # Output: "Positive review"
📈 Results & Accuracy
✔️ Accuracy: 88%
✔️ Strong Classification Report: High precision, recall, and F1-score

📜 Future Improvements
🔹 Enhance dataset size for better generalization
🔹 Try deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers)
🔹 Deploy as a web app using Flask or FastAPI
